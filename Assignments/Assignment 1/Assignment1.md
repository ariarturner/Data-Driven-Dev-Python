# Program Assignment 1

## Summary
This project requires knowledge of only some very basic operations on numeric values. This program should ask for input from a user and then calculate several simple mathematical rate conversions.

## Requirements
This program should ask for the user to input a floating point number denoting the amount of jet fuel to be purchased in gallons.
The program will then compute and output the following information, including:
- Reprint the value that was input by the user  (number of gallons of jet fuel)
- The equivalent number of liters
- The number of barrels of oil required
- The number of pounds of CO~2 produced
- The number of BTUs (British Thermal Units) produced
- The number of pounds the jet fuel weighs
- Price in US dollars
- The number of hours and minutes that a 787 aircraft can fly on that amount of jet fuel
These values should be calculated using named constants with standard convention (all uppercase).
The user's input should be rounded to two decimal points. All output should also be rounded to two decimal places.

## Constants
- 1 gallon is equivalent to 3.7854 liters
- 1 barrel of oil produces 4 gallons of jet fuel
- 1 barrel holds 42 gallons of oil
- 1 gallon of jet fuel produces approximately 21.095 pounds of CO~2
- 1 gallon of jet fuel produces 128,100 BTUs
- 1 gallon of jet fuel weighs 6.7 pounds
- The average price for a gallon of jet fuel is $1.88/gallon
- A 787 aircraft burns 1,600 gallons of fuel per hour
