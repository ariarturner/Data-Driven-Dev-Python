# Programming Assignment 2

## Summary
This project requires knowledge of string methods and conditional statements along with some math operations in order to process text. This project should locate the first occurence of a keyword in a text file and output the sentence in which the keyword appears.

## Requirements
This program should ask for the user to input the name of a text file located in the same folder as the program

This program should output the contents of the specified text file

This program should ask for the user to input a keyword

This program should ask for the user to input a line length

This program should output the sentence with the first occurance of the specified keyword
- the keyword is not case sensitive
- the sentence should be output with the same formatting as in the original text file, with the exception that the keyword should be in all upper case

This program should output a schema based on the specified line length.
- the output displays lines of dots that represent each character in the entire text file used, other than line breaks
- the output displays the position of the keyword in all upper case within the entire text based on the number of characters per line specified by the user

This program should notify the user if the specified keyword does not exist in the text

## Notes about Text Files, Keywords, and Line Length
The only non-alphanumeric characters in the text files will be the punctuation symbols ,:;-.!?"'

Keywords will contain no spaces and will never be longer than 11 characters

Line length will be an integer greater than 10
